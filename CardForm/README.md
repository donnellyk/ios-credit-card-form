# Braintree Payments UI for iOS

Braintree Payments UI is an iOS library that enables you to create a simple, native UI for collecting payment information, including credit card details and PayPal accounts.

This library is comprised of dumb views and controls without much logic or ability to communicate with a payments processor. We compose these in our ideal Drop In payments experience in Drop In.

## Usage

To run the example project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. Then, open up the xcworkspace and run the demo app.

## Installation

Braintree Payments UI is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Braintree/UI'
```
